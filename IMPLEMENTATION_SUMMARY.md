# Procedural Event System Implementation - Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive procedural event system for "Depths of the Fractured Mind" that meets all requirements specified in the issue and design document.

## ✅ Deliverables Completed

### 1. Core Event System Module

**Files Created:**
- `src/game/events/types.ts` - Complete type definitions for events, choices, effects, and triggers
- `src/game/events/loader.ts` - Async JSON loader with conversion logic
- `src/game/events/procedural.ts` - Procedural selection and trigger condition evaluation
- `src/game/events/engine.ts` - Enhanced with new functionality (existing file)
- `src/game/events/resolvers.ts` - Enhanced effect resolution (existing file)

**Key Features:**
- ✅ External, data-driven event definitions
- ✅ Runtime event loading from JSON files
- ✅ Type-safe event system with full TypeScript support
- ✅ Clean separation between engine code and content
- ✅ Support for event chains and follow-up events

### 2. Procedural/Random Generation

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Event pools with different selection strategies (random, weighted, sequential)
- ✅ Trigger conditions based on:
  - Depth range (min/max/specific)
  - Game flags and moral alignment
  - Party composition and character status
  - Custom condition functions
- ✅ Weighted randomization with priority system
- ✅ Mandatory event prioritization
- ✅ Depth-specific event pools

**Selection Algorithm:**
1. Check for incomplete mandatory events
2. Evaluate trigger conditions
3. Filter available events
4. Apply weighted randomization
5. Return selected event or null

### 3. Event Content

**Mandatory Events (4 total):**
1. **Pit Fall Event** - Floor collapse with rescue choices (Depth 2-3)
2. **Overflow Ward Event** - Comatose patients on failing life support (Depth 3)
3. **Riot Recording Event** - Elias confronts evidence of brutality (Depth 2)
4. **Confessional Chair Event** - Anya faces betrayal of confidences (Depth 3-4)

**Optional Events (8 total):**
1. **Whispering Tunnel** - Subject 13 hears mysterious voices
2. **Medical Supply Cache** - Resource discovery event
3. **Dying Patient Encounter** - Moral choice with suffering patient
4. **Mirror Room Hallucination** - Confronting reflections in Depth 4
5. **Former Colleague Encounter** - Twisted former staff member
6. **Subject 13 Origin Fragment** - Identity and past exploration
7. **Experimental Chamber** - Miriam confronts her experiments
8. **Prayer Remnants** - Anya's faith tested

**Event Pools (5 total):**
- `mandatory_events` - Core story progression events
- `optional_events` - General side events
- `depth_2_events` - Archive-specific events
- `depth_3_events` - Ward-specific events
- `depth_4_events` - Labyrinth-specific events

### 4. Stateful Consequences

- ✅ Sanity changes (individual or party-wide)
- ✅ HP changes
- ✅ Moral flag adjustments (Mercy/Cruelty, Truth/Denial)
- ✅ Game flag setting (event completion, character states)

- ✅ Event chaining via nextEventId
- ✅ Custom party transformations

**Character Arc Flags:**

## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements (Event System Review - Dec 2024)

### Issues Addressed

**Problem:** Users reported "Event not found: pit_fall_event" errors during gameplay.

**Root Cause:** Race condition between asynchronous event loading from JSON and immediate event triggering during player movement.

### Fixes Implemented

1. **Defensive Event Checks**
   - Movement system now verifies events exist before triggering
   - Prevents mode transition if event is missing
   - Logs helpful warnings when events not yet loaded

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Better error messages in `startEvent()` with event registry listing
   - UI shows helpful error messages with recovery options
   - Console logging shows available events when lookup fails

3. **Loading State Management**
   - Added loading indicator on title screen
   - Prevents player actions until events are ready
   - Graceful fallback to hardcoded events if JSON fails

4. **Event ID Consistency**
   - Fixed fallback event IDs to match JSON versions
   - Validator now checks critical event IDs
   - Prevents accidental mismatches between code and data

5. **Improved Documentation**
   - Created `docs/EVENT_SYSTEM.md` with architecture overview
   - Added `docs/EVENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for debugging
   - Documented event lifecycle and best practices

### Validation Improvements

The event validator now checks:
- All critical event IDs exist (`pit_fall_event`, `overflow_ward_event`, etc.)
- Event references in code match JSON definitions
- Provides specific errors for missing critical events

### Testing

All tests pass:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation (strict mode)
- ✅ Event validation with critical checks
- ✅ Production build
- ✅ CodeQL security scan
- ✅ Code review addressed

## 🎮 Replayability Impact

The procedural event system dramatically improves replayability:

1. **Randomized Event Order:** Mandatory events appear in different sequences
2. **Optional Variety:** Different side events each playthrough
3. **State-Based Branching:** Choices affect which events appear later
4. **Multiple Character Arcs:** Different outcomes for each character
5. **Moral Alignment Paths:** Events adapt to player's moral choices

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

The system is designed to support future additions:

- Inventory system integration (hooks already in place)
- More complex trigger conditions
- Dynamic event generation from templates
- Character relationship system
- Timed or turn-based events
- Event history tracking
- Save/load integration

## ✅ Quality Assurance

- [x] All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [x] All builds successful (dev and production)
- [x] Event JSON validated with no errors
- [x] Code review completed and feedback addressed
- [x] Security scan completed (no issues)
- [x] Documentation comprehensive and clear
- [x] Examples provided for all integration patterns
- [x] Test page functional and useful

## 🎉 Conclusion

The procedural event system is **complete and production-ready**. It provides:

- A robust, flexible foundation for narrative events
- Full randomization and replayability
- Easy content expansion without code changes
- Comprehensive documentation and tools
- Clean integration with existing game systems

All requirements from the issue have been met and exceeded. The system is ready for integration into the main game loop.
